# PINE minesweeper

This was one of the projects I made over the first Covid lockdown, when I was 16. I made it using Pygame and assets I created myself using microsoft paint. It is exclusively coded in python.

I set myself a challenge to make minesweeper from scratch in 3 hours and this finished product is what I produced.
